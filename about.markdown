My name is Yusuf. I'm a data scientist based in Berlin. I studied Finance and Chinese at the University of Southern California and spent a year working in venture capital in Silicon Valley. Though I enjoyed the experience, I wanted to transition to more technical challenges in development and data science. I love the satisfaction of being able to use data and statistics to tell stories. This blog is for me to explore topics in machine learning, data science, and whatever else might interest me. I hope you enjoy!
